## ⭐️ Sponsor: Contest prep
- [x] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [x] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/README.md))
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [x] Ensure that you have access to the _findings_ repo where issues will be submitted.
- [ ] Promote the contest on Twitter (optional: tag in relevant protocols, etc.)
- [ ] Share it with your own communities (blog, Discord, Telegram, email newsletters, etc.)
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Designate someone (or a team of people) to monitor DMs & questions in the C4 Discord (**#questions** channel) daily (Note: please *don't* discuss issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.
